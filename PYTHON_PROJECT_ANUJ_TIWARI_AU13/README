 Python Chess Game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is a player versus computer implementation of chess using the pygame library 
for Python. 

It includes all the essential rules for chess. The computer player uses the minimax 
strategy with alpha-beta pruning for generating and deciding moves. 

It explores all possible moves, then explores
their possible moves and so on. This essentially creates a search tree to a depth of 3.

The best move is decided by evaluating the 'score' of the board. 

A graphical representation of the board is rendered with a side menu with contextual tips,
that displays useful information such as whose turn it is, if the move you're
attempting is invalid, if someone is in check, among other things.

The mouse is used to select pieces and move them. 

The program only allows you to make valid moves according to the rules of chess, and also includes the
special moves: castling, and promotion. 

The program automatically detects check and checkmate, and for the latter, ends the game and declares the winner.
